# MumbaiHomePrices

Model to predict prices of residents in various location.

In this data science project I build a real estate price prediction model. First I build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com.
It covered almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc. Technology and tools wise this project covers:

    Python
    Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
    Matplotlib for data visualization
    Sklearn for model building
    Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
